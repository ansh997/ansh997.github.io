  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am an MS-Research student at IIIT Hyderabad, specializing in Geometric Deep Learning, Temporal Graph Learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs). My research focuses on scalable AI architectures, knowledge graphs, adversarial robustness, and multimodal learningâ€”driving AI innovation for both academic and industry applications.</p>

  <p>I have worked on federated learning, fine-tuning large models, and optimizing LLMs for efficiency and security, with publications in top AI venues. My experience extends to applying AI in real-world settings, from financial modeling at Barclays to AI-driven systems for robust and scalable inference.</p>
