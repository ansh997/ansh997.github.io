  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a Machine Learning Researcher with a passion for AI, deep learning, and large-scale knowledge systems. Currently pursuing an MS-Research in Computer Science at IIIT Hyderabad, my work focuses on Geometric Deep Learning, Temporal Graph Learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs). I specialize in federated learning, adversarial robustness, and scalable AI architectures, aiming to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world AI applications.

    With 3+ years of experience in AI and data science, I have worked at Barclays as a Macro Structuring Analyst, where I developed AI-driven predictive models for financial markets, optimizing risk assessment and trading strategies for 10,000+ trades across 25 strategies. My expertise in LLM fine-tuning, AI model optimization, and knowledge graphs extends into both research and industry applications.</p>

  <p>I have worked on federated learning, fine-tuning large models, and optimizing LLMs for efficiency and security, with publications in top AI venues. My experience extends to applying AI in real-world settings, from financial modeling at Barclays to AI-driven systems for robust and scalable inference.</p>
