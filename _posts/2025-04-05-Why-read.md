Every time you procrastinate reading, whether it's a textbook, a novel, or even a short article, you're robbing a version of yourself that could have existed. The version of you who understood the world a little better. Who could have caught a life-changing idea in one paragraph, who could have found comfort in a sentence at exactly the right time.  You're leaving that version of yourself behind. And the worst part? Books are patient. They'll wait, but time won't. One day, you'll realize that the knowledge, the wisdom, or even the simple joy you could have had is something you now need, urgently.  But by then, it won't be a leisurely read anymore. It'll be a desperate search. Reading isn't just learning. It's quietly building the person you'll need to be for the hardest days of your life. Don't leave that person unprepared.
