Long ago, pigeons lived in the cracks of human homes, longing for a place of their own. They envied the birds who built beautiful nests and decided it was time to learn the art of nest-making.

The pigeons flew to the Baya Weaver, the finest nest-builder of the forests. "Teach us how to build a strong and beautiful nest!" they pleaded.

The Baya Weaver agreed and began the lessons. "First, you must find the right tree," she said. She showed them how to search for branches strong enough to hold a nest. Then, she taught them to collect the finest twigs, grass, and leaves to weave together. Day after day, the pigeons followed, but soon they grew tired.

"This is too much work!" they grumbled. "We have to fly so much, gather so much, and weave so carefully. There must be an easier way!" And so, they left, never completing their training.

Next, they went to the Grey Francolin, who made her nest on the ground. "Teach us your way, for your nest seems simple," they said.

The Francolin agreed and showed them how to find soft earth, hidden among thick bushes to stay safe from predators. She taught them how to line their nests with warm leaves. The pigeons tried, but once again, they grew restless.

"This takes too long!" they sighed. "We must find an even simpler way."

So, they abandoned the Francolin too.

Tired and without a home, the pigeons flew back to human houses. They tucked themselves into windowsills, under bridges, and on rooftops.

"This will do," they told themselves. "Why struggle when shelter is already here?" And so, pigeons never learned to build nests of their own.
